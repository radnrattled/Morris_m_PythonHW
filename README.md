#Megan's Rock Paper Scissors Game

##The Purpose of learning Python (text based take on a classic!)

Pick your weapon and play against the compouter- you"ll only get a virtual sting if you lose! 

Prerequisites: all you need is Python 3 to play. 

Close the project, cd to your directory/ download and run the game.py file in Python3 Terminal window for Mac/Linux, or the powershell for windows.

The Rules are the same as the classic game:
1.Paper covers rock
2. Scissors cuts paper
3. Rock smashes scissors

Choose your weapon wisely! 

Built with Python 3

Enjoy!
